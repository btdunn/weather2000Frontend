# WEATHER 2000
See simulated weather from the year 2000

## About
A simple and underwhelming simulated weather app with the garish trappings of a late 90s early 2000s geocities site. Check the weather from several major cities and enjoy the loud aesthetic. Primarily made to learn Node and React Hooks in roughly 3 days.

## Under the Hood
-React 16.13.1
-Node 6.14.5
-Sqlite3 5.0.0
-Express 4.17.1
-Knex 0.21.5
-Objection 2.2.3


## Install
To start seeing some fake weather, install locally by cloning the github repositories. For the backend run npx knex migrate:latest, npx knex seed:run and node index.js. For the frontend, npm install and npm start.
